    "* a shapefile (extension ```.shp```) of the geologic units of Colorado.\n",
    "* a Google Earth Keyhole Markup Language file (extension ```.kml```) containing all reported mineral deposits known within Colorado\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Edited from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Mineral_Belt)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Colorado Mineral Belt (CMB) is an area of ore deposits from the La Plata Mountains in Southwestern Colorado to near the middle of the state at Boulder, Colorado and from which over 25 million troy ounces (778 t) of gold were extracted beginning in 1858. The belt is a northeast-striking zone defined by: \n",
    "\n",
    "* A shear zone system aged 2500Ma to 541Ma.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anomalous concentrations of chalcophile and siderophilic elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A major gravity low\n",
    "\n",
    "* And abnormal heat flow considering its location over thick continental crust\n",
    "\n",
    "The belt lies within a zone that has been geologically active at intervals beginning from at least 1.6 billion years ago until the present. Parts of the CMB follow shear zones of Precambrian through Mesozoic age (>541-65 Ma). Igneous rocks intruded about 60 to 70 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny are associated with the belt and once were thought to be responsible for most of the ore deposits. Now many of the important ore deposits are thought to be genetically related to younger magmatism, some as young as ~25 million years.\n",

    "# Prerequesite Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to ```Numpy```,```Pandas```, and ```matplotlib```, you will need the package ```geopandas```. ```geopandas``` is a popular package for manipulating geospatial point and polygon data and can be used to create publication quality images. To install all the above packages, activate the environment using ```activate <environment>```(Windows) or ```source activate <environment>``` (Mac/Linux) after you have installed [miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) some additional setup might be needed if Powershell or terminal doesn't automatically recognize your commands. \n",

    "   vv\n",
    "   \n",
    "\"*cogeol_dd_polygon.shp*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "then you can use the string ```COgeo_dd/cogeo_dd_polygon.shp``` to refer to the relative file location. Note that ```.shp``` files have associated other file types (```.sbx```,```.shx``` etc;) that must exist in the same folder as ```.shp``` for you to use the shapefile.\n",
