# PythonPals

**PythonPals** is an IE sponsored Community designed to give CMES analytic tools needed to be more effective within and outside the academic community. We do this by focusing on a myriad of hard-to-learn concepts revolving around pythonic science, including:

 * Data Visualization tools and when to use them
 * Filetypes common across the geosciences
 * Manipulation of data structures
 * Making maintainable and cross work-group code

The modules and Jupyter notebook tutorials contained within this repository are designed to be done collaboratively, as most good science is.
